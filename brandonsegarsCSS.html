                We are spending the Holidays<br>together as a family. It will just<br>be my wife and my two daughters.<br>We will hopefully be spending<br>most of the time at the house and<br>sitting by the fireplace.

                I am glad that I get a break from work<br>and from my night classes. Night school<br>is really<strong>tough!</strong>I will probably be<br>doing some homework or working on a <br>group project of some kind. But at least<br>I get to be with my family.
